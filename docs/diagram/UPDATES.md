## Technical Improvements

### CPG Architecture Representation
- **Biological Accuracy**: Diagrams now accurately represent Hopf oscillator dynamics
- **Network Topology**: Shows proper 6-oscillator hexapod configuration
- **Real-time Integration**: Demonstrates balance feedback and obstacle avoidance
- **Gait Coordination**: Illustrates tripod, wave, and ripple gait support

### Autonomous Navigation Integration
- **Sensor Integration**: Shows ultrasonic sensor data flow to CPG system
- **Adaptive Control**: Demonstrates real-time path adjustment capabilities
- **Safety Features**: Includes emergency stop and obstacle response mechanisms

### System States Enhancement
- **Operational Modes**: Clear distinction between manual and autonomous operation
- **State Transitions**: Proper handling of mode switches and error recovery
- **Hardware States**: Integration of CPG states with hardware control states

## Build System Integration
- All diagrams successfully compile to PNG format using `./scripts/build.sh -l`
- Generated files saved to `docs/diagram/image/` directory
- No syntax errors or compilation issues
- All 6 diagrams (building, class, component, deployment, sequence, state) generated successfully

## Compatibility
- **Legacy Support**: Maintains legacy controller components for backward compatibility
- **Incremental Migration**: Shows both CPG and legacy systems coexisting
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Preserves existing hardware interface layer

## Documentation Standards
- Maintained existing copyright headers and GPL license notices
- Consistent styling and formatting across all diagrams
- Comprehensive legends and technical notes
- Professional diagram layout with clear visual hierarchy

The updated documentation now accurately reflects the CPG-integrated autonomous hexapod system while maintaining compatibility with existing legacy components.
