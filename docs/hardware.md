Note: The secondary controller is optional. If using only one controller, leg 5's knee and ankle joints must be remapped to unused channels or a different solution implemented.

## MPU6050 IMU Configuration

The MPU6050 provides orientation data for the hexapod:

| Parameter           | Configuration                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| I2C Address         | 0x68                          |
| Accelerometer Range | ±2g                           |
| Gyroscope Range     | ±500 degrees/second           |
| Sample Rate         | 100Hz                         |
| Low-Pass Filter     | 10Hz                          |
| Orientation         | X forward, Y right, Z up      |

### Power Management

The MPU6050 has built-in power management features that may put it into sleep mode after periods of inactivity. The driver automatically handles waking the device when readings are requested, ensuring consistent sensor data even after extended periods between readings.

Key power management features:
- Sleep mode: Automatically entered to conserve power
- Wake-on-read: Driver automatically detects and wakes the device when readings are requested
- Clock source: PLL with X-axis gyroscope reference for stability
