# Hexapod Robot Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The hexapod robot control system is implemented as a user-space application interfacing with kernel-space drivers. The system provides control over six legs, each with three degrees of freedom (hip, knee, ankle), and includes IMU sensing capabilities.

## Key Components

### 1. Gait Control System
- Supports multiple gait patterns:
  - Tripod gait (alternating three legs)
  - Wave gait (sequential leg movement)
  - Ripple gait (overlapping leg movements)
- Configurable parameters:
  - Step height
  - Step length
  - Cycle time
  - Duty factor

### 2. Kinematics Module
- Forward kinematics: converts joint angles to end-effector position
- Inverse kinematics: converts desired position to joint angles
- Handles workspace boundary checking
- Provides trajectory generation capabilities

### 3. Hardware Interface
- Servo control for 18 joints (3 per leg)
- MPU6050 IMU integration for orientation sensing
- Device driver communication through ioctl interface
