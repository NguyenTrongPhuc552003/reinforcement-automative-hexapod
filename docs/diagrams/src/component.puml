' Notes for clarity
note right of HexapodIF
  C++ class that abstracts
  the hardware details
  from higher-level code
end note

note bottom of MainDriver
  Core kernel module that
  coordinates all hardware
  communication
end note

note right of I2CBus
  I2C Bus 3 on BeagleBone
  SCL: P9_19, SDA: P9_20
end note

note bottom of PWM2
  Each controller provides
  16 PWM channels at 50Hz
  with 12-bit resolution
end note
