' Notes based on code documentation
note right of app
  C++ applications that provide:
  - Manual control
  - Autonomous movement
  - Calibration utilities 
  - TD3 reinforcement learning
end note

note right of driver
  Kernel modules handle:
  - I2C communication
  - PWM signal generation
  - Servo positioning
  - IMU data acquisition
end note

note bottom of servos
  18 servos total:
  - 6 hip joints
  - 6 knee joints
  - 6 ankle joints
  Each controlled through PWM signals
