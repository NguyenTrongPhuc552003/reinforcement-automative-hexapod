# Hexapod Robot Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the reinforcement learning-enabled hexapod robot project. The documentation covers hardware specifications, software architecture, quickstart guides, and detailed diagrams.

## Documentation Overview

| File                                        | Description                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [architecture.md](overview/architecture.md) | Detailed software architecture, design patterns, and component interactions   |
| [hardware.md](overview/hardware.md)         | Hardware specifications, wiring diagrams, and component assembly instructions |
| [quickstart.md](overview/quickstart.md)     | Getting started guide for new users to quickly set up and operate the hexapod |

## Diagram Documentation

The `diagrams/` directory contains PlantUML source files that generate various system diagrams:

| Diagram                                        | Description                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| [class.puml](diagram/src/class.puml)           | Class diagrams showing software component relationships    |
| [component.puml](diagram/src/component.puml)   | Component diagrams illustrating system modules             |
| [sequence.puml](diagram/src/sequence.puml)     | Sequence diagrams for key interactions and processes       |
| [state.puml](diagram/src/state.puml)           | State machine diagrams for robot control states            |
| [deployment.puml](diagram/src/deployment.puml) | Deployment diagrams showing hardware/software distribution |
| [building.puml](diagram/src/building.puml)     | Diagrams explaining the build and compilation process      |

## Generating Diagrams

The PlantUML diagrams can be generated into visual formats using the following commands:

```bash
# Generate all diagrams
./scripts/build.sh -l
```

Generated diagrams will be saved in the docs/diagram/image/ directory as their source files with `.png` extensions.

## Viewing Documentation

For the best viewing experience, use a Markdown viewer or editor that supports:

- Tables
- Code highlighting
- Image embedding

You can view the documentation directly on GitHub or use tools like VSCode with the Markdown Preview extension.

## Contributing to Documentation
When contributing to the documentation, please follow these guidelines:
1. Use clear, concise language
2. Include code examples where appropriate
3. Add diagrams for complex concepts
4. Ensure code snippets are syntax-highlighted
5. Keep the documentation up to date with code changes

Document Formatting should follow these formatting conventions:
- Use headings (#, ##, ###) for section organization
- Use code blocks with language specifiers:
```cpp
// C++ code example
```
- Use tables for structured information
- Use bullet points for lists
- Include cross-references to other documents when relevant
